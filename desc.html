              competition is 41 U.S.C. 1903 as implemented by the Federal

            </h3>
            <p class="primary-paragraph">
              ESI Services, LLC is the only source for the required software
              licenses and maintenance support. The manufacturer of VA s
              perpetual licenses of COBOL-IT Complier Suite plus Run Time
              Software Enterprise Sun SPARC software is COBOL-IT which is
              located at 231 Rue, Saint-Honor, 75001 Paris, France, and COBOL-IT
              has designated only one North American distributor: ESI Services,
              LLC. The current 10 infrastructure is based on existing COBOL-IT
              software, and no other software licenses can interoperate with VA
              s current COBOL-IT software infrastructure due to the proprietary
              protocols utilized by COBOL-IT. Therefore, VA requires software
              licenses and maintenance support compatible with the existing
              infrastructure protocols and functionality to ensure continued
              operational functionality. COBOL-IT provides compilers for file
              migration that are switch-compatible (making the files compatible
              across applications without the need for software solutions and
              licensing agreements) with the previous vendor, minimizing any
              rework needed in the hundreds of files used to build COBOL
              programs. Only COBOL-IT can provide the necessary software
              updates, due to the proprietary source code, required to develop
              and implement software updates.

            </h3>
            <p class="primary-paragraph">
              Acquisition of a different product, even if another one existed
              with qualifications that met VA's standard functional needs, would
              require duplicative support costs such as: the procurement of new
              software licenses, as no other software is compatible or
              interoperable with the existing COBOL-IT proprietary database
              structures, protocols, and software application programming
              interfaces; and fully re-compiling and re-deploying all
              applications that utilize this software. This effort would require
              a dedicated release cycle and a full regression and performance
              test. The processes to completely replace VA s current COBOL IT
              infrastructure would cost at least $1,000,000 and would require at
              least 4 months to complete, based on historical efforts.
              Furthermore, any change to COBOL-IT code will impact all Veterans
              Benefits Administration (VBA) applications as COBOL-IT code
              provides core benefits services used by all VBA applications such
              as SHARE and Veterans Benefits Management System (VBMS). If
              unsuccessful, the 50,000 VBA employees who regularly access these
              systems will be unable to perform their duties. Therefore, only an
              authorized COBOL-IT reseller can provide the additional software
              licenses and maintenance support that meets the Government's
              requirements.

              and maintenance support. The research was focused on COBOL
              software, specifically the four COBOL products indicated as
              approved on the VA Technical Reference Model (TRM). The TRM also
              identified additional approved COBOL add-on products that do not
